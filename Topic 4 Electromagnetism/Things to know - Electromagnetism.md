# Things to know - Electromagnetism
***




### 1. What is north and south? 
***
#### Rules for magnetism:
- There are two kinds of magnetic poles (North and South).
- Like poles repel.
- Unlike poles attract.

<pre></pre>
- The magnetic field move from **north** to **south**

**Do not confuse North and South magnetic poles with $+$ and $-$ charges**



<pre>

</pre>
### 2. Fun facts
***
1. Permanent magnets are composed of **magnetic domains** which each behave like a tiny bar magnet. This is called the <u>domain theory of magnetism</u>.
2. The north end of a compass points towards geographic north which is the south magnetic pole.
3. The earth's magnetic field deflects harmful radiation.

### 3. Hand rules
***
Note:
- The terms **current** and **conventional current** refers to the movement of <u>positive</u> charges
- **Electron current** or **electron flow** refers to the movement of <u>negative</u> charges

- A dot means that the current to coming out of the page
- a cross means that the current is going into the page

**Rules:**
1. The [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#First hand rule | first hand rule]] indicates the **direction** of the **magnetic field** around a current <u>carrying wire</u>.

2. The [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Second hand rule | second hand rule]] indicates the **magnetic field direction** for a <u>coil of wire</u> (i.e. a solenoid).

3. The [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Third hand rule | third hand rule]] indicates the **direction** of the **force** when a <u>charged particle enters a magnetic field</u>.


<pre></pre>
#### First hand rule 
**Direction** of the **magnetic field** around a <u>current-carrying wire</u>\
*https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/physical-processes/magnetism-mcat/a/using-the-right-hand-rule*
***
- If the term, "**current**" or "**conventional current**" is used, use your <u>right hand</u>
- If the term "**electron current**" or "**electron flow**" is used, use your <u>left hand</u>
 
<pre></pre> 
- The **thumb** points in the <u>direction of the current</u>
- The **fingers** curl around the wire indicating the <u>direction of the magnetic field</u>.
	- Note that the direction of the magnetic field is **around the wire**.

For wires, the [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Rules for magnetism | rules for magnetism]] still apply. Opposite polarities attract and like polarities repel.
> Ex:\
Two $0.50m$ long wires are parallel to one another. The electrical current traveling through one wire is equal and opposite in direction to the current traveling through the other. The two wires will experience:
> 
> - **A.** a repulsive force because the magnetic fields are in the same direction
> 
> - **B.** an attractive force because the two magnetic fields are in the same direction
> 
> - **C.** a repulsive force because the magnetic fields are in opposite directions
> 
> - **D.** an attractive force because the magnetic fields are in opposite directions
> 
> Answer:**A**\
> Using the [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#First hand rule | first hand rule]], we can figure out that the magnetic fields are in the same direction. Since like polarities repel, the two wires will experience a repulsive force

<pre></pre>
#### Second hand rule
**Magnetic field direction** for a <u>coil of wire</u> (i.e. a solenoid)
***
- If the term, "**current**" or "**conventional current**" is used, use your <u>right hand</u>
- If the term "**electron current**" or "**electron flow**" is used, use your <u>left hand</u>

<pre></pre>
- **Fingers** curl in the <u>direction of the current</u>
- **Thumb** will point in the <u>direction of the magnetic field lines</u> in the core of the solenoid
	- Note: the magnetic field of an electromagnet is similar to the field of a bar magnet.


<pre></pre>
#### Third hand rule
**Direction** of the **force** when a <u>charged particle enters a magnetic field</u>.
***
- **Fingers** point in the direction of the external magnetic field (B) from north to south.
- **Thumb** points in the direction of the particle’s motion (v).
- **Palm** indicates the direction of the resulting force on the particle (F).


<pre></pre>
#### Combined hand rule (motor + generator effect)
1. **Fingers** point in the direction of the <u>magnetic field</u>.
2. **Thumb** points in the direction of what is <u>input</u> or **primary**. 
3. **Palm** points in the <u>output</u> or **secondary** direction.

### 4. Deflecting force on a charge 
***
$$
\begin{align}
F_B = F_m &= qvB\text{sin}\theta \\
F_m &= qvB_\perp
\end{align}
$$

- $F_m$ and $F_B$ are the same thing
- When $\theta$ is $90^\circ$, $\text{sin}\theta$ can be omitted 
- Even though $F_m$ is a vector, if $\theta \neq 90^\circ$, direction is not required to be stated


<pre></pre>
#### In magnetic fields
$$
\begin{align}
F_m &= F_c \\
qvB_\perp &= \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
r &= \frac{mv}{qB_\perp}
\end{align}
$$
**<center>This equation must be derived</center>**

The magnetic field acts as a centripetal force on the particle


<pre></pre>
#### Velocity selectors
$$
\begin{align}
F_E &= F_B \\
q|\vec{E}| &= qvB_\perp \\
|\vec{E}| &= vB_\perp \\
v &= \frac{|\vec{E}|}{B_\perp} \\
\end{align}
$$
**<center>This equation must be derived</center>**

If $F_E \neq F_B$, the particle will not pass through the velocity selector. Th

#### Mass spectrometer
A mass spectrometer separates particles based on their masses. It combines a [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Velocity selectors | velocity selector]] with a [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#In magnetic fields | ion separator]]

<pre></pre>
###### Addendum 4-1:
	 Atoms and shit:
		- Its atomic number is its number of protons
		- Its atomic weight is its number of protons and neutrons
<pre></pre>

Solving:
1. <u>If velocity is not given:</u> Solve [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Velocity selectors | velocity selector]] to get velocity
$$
\begin{align}
F_E &= F_B \\
q|\vec{E}| &= qvB_\perp \\
|\vec{E}| &= vB_\perp \\
v &= \frac{|\vec{E}|}{B_\perp} \\
\end{align}
$$

2. To determine whatever else: [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#In magnetic fields | ion separator]]
$$
\begin{align}
F_m &= F_c \\
qvB_\perp &= \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
r &= \frac{mv}{qB_\perp}
\end{align}
$$

### 5. Deflecting force on a wire:
***
$$
\begin{align}
F_B = F_m &= BIl\text{sin}\theta \\
F_m &= B_\perp Il
\end{align}
$$
- When $\theta$ is $90^\circ$, $\text{sin}\theta$ can be omitted 
- Even though $F_m$ is a vector, if $\theta \neq 90^\circ$, direction is not required to be stated

#### Current balance
$$
\begin{align}
F_g &= F_M \\
mg &= B_\perp Il 
\end{align}
$$

*Remember: $l$ (in a block $ABCD$) is the length $BC$. The magnetic forces in the length $AB$ and $CD$ work against each other.

### 6. Motor/Generator
***
- The key element necessary for the generator effect was a **changing** (or moving) magnetic field.

<pre></pre>
#### Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic
***A changing magnetic field induces a current in a conductor***\
Remember the [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Combined hand rule motor generator effect | combined hand rule]]

<pre></pre>
#### Lenz's Law
***An induced current flows in such a direction that the induced magnetic field it creates opposes the action of the inducing magnetic field.***\
Remember the [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Combined hand rule motor generator effect | combined hand rule]]

Three distinct phenomena are involved in the process of electromagnetic induction, and they must be clearly distinguished:
1. The action of the “inducing field”.  (In this case, the bar magnet.)
2. The resulting “induced current”.  (The induced current in the coil.)
3. The “induced magnetic field” created by the induced current.  (Induced magnetic field of the coil.

### 7. The principles of electromagnetism
***
A constant electric current in a conductor induces a uniform, constant magnetic field that circles the conductor. The electric current and magnetic field are perpendicular.
- constant electric current $\longrightarrow$ constant magnetic field

When a **conductor moves** through a **perpendicular magnetic** field, a uniform, constant current is induced in the conductor.
- move conductor through $\perp$ magnetic field $\longrightarrow$ constant current

<pre>

</pre>

A changing electric field in space will generate a changing magnetic field that is perpendicular to the electric field.
- changing electric field $\longrightarrow$ changing magnetic field

A changing magnetic field in space will generate a changing electric field that is perpendicular to the magnetic field.
- changing magnetic field $\longrightarrow$ changing electric field

### 8. Propagation of electromagnetic waves

An electric field, $E_1$, crates a magnetic field, $B_1$. This magnetic field makes another electric field, $E_2$. This cycle continues to create a electromagnetic wave.
