### 1. Dalton's Postulates
*https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/electronic-structure-of-atoms/history-of-atomic-structure/a/daltons-atomic-theory-version-2*
***
1. All matter is made of <u>atoms</u>.
2. All atoms of a <u>given element are identical</u> in mass and properties.
3. Atoms are <u>unchangeable</u>.
4. Compounds are <u>combinations</u> of two or more different types of <u>atoms</u>.
5. A chemical reaction is a <u>rearrangement</u> of atoms.



<pre>

</pre>
### 2. The periodic table of elements
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#History*
***
#### Julius Meyer
Plotted atomic size against atomic mass. He concluded the the properties of the elements might be periodic (reoccurring).

<pre></pre>
#### Dimitri Mendeleev
Ordered the table in <u>**increasing atomic mass**</u> while accounting for the families of elements.
- Increasing horizontally
- Grouped vertically according to properties

Was able to predict 3 undiscovered elements

<pre></pre>
<u>**There were 2 mistakes:**</u>

**Mass was not increasing** for 2 elements. He was forced to group them based on their properties. He believed so strongly in the chemical families, he believed that the mass of said elements were wrong.

<pre></pre>
#### Henry Moseley
He corrected Mendeleev. The horizontal rows are **increasing by the number of protons** (atomic number) and not the atomic weight. This is correct.

***
#### John Dalton - Atomic Model
Claims:
- The atom is the smallest possible particle
- Invisible 

He was:
- wrong

<pre></pre>
#### Thomson - Plum-Pudding Model
Claims:
- Atoms consists of $+$ and $-$ charges
- The atom is **neutral**

Thompson's model was a result of the findings of the [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Thomson experiment - Electrons | cathode ray tube]].	

<pre></pre>
#### Rutherford - Nuclear Model (Gold foil experiment)
Claims:
- Atoms are mostly **empty** space
- Center of the atom is the nucleus which is where most of the mass and positive charge is
- Electrons move around the nucleus

Could not explain:
- If the electrons were in the <u>same orbit</u> and why they did not collide
- How electrons are involved in <u>chemical bonding</u>
- Why the protons stay together in the <u>nucleus</u>
- Why they did not continually <u>radiate EMR</u> event they continually experience centripetal acceleration (accelerating charges radiate EMR)
- Why the electrons don't <u>spiral into the nucleus</u> despite their $E_K$ being converted to radiant energy

##### The gold foil experiment
Rutherford was a student of Thomson. He developed some experiments to verify [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Thomson - Plum-Pudding Model | Thomson's model]]. 

<pre></pre>
The experiment:

Alpha particles were fired at atom thick gold foil. There was a zinc sulfide screen around the foil which would glow when a particle hit it.

According to [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Thomson - Plum-Pudding Model | Thomson's model]], most of the alpha particles would not be appreciably deflected. 

In reality, many alpha particles were deflected. Some were deflected at large (around $90^\circ$)

Rutherford proposed a model of the atom where most of the mass and all of the $+$ charge was in the center of the atom. The rest would be empty space except for a few electrons.

<pre></pre>
#### Bohr - Planetary Model
Postulates:
1. Electrons move in circular orbits, but do not radiate energy. These orbits are called stationary states.
2. Electrons can "jump" from one stationary state to another, but they cannot exist between them. 

$$
hf = |E_f-E_i|
$$

3. There only a few orbits allowed around the nucleus. Each orbit has a characteristic energy and radius. 

Strengths:
- It could explain the size of the hydrogen atom
- Gave an ionization value for hydrogen
- (With some modifications), he found that all of the elements in a vertical column had the same number of electrons in their outer most energy level
- Gave an explanation for the structure of the electron cloud

Problems:
- Bohr's postulates do not work for multi-electron atoms (it only works with hydrogen)
- Could not explain why the number of spectral lines increased for some elements when they were placed in electric and magnetic fields
- Was not able to explain the relative intensity of some of the spectral lines


<pre>

</pre>
### 4. Cathode Ray Tube
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube*
***
#### Discovery
Gas discharge tube experiments were popular. A difficulty was that the air blocked the particles from reaching the anode from the cathode.

Technology improved to where most of the air could be evacuated. Eugene Goldstein gave the name, **cathode ray** to the beam because it came from the cathode. 

In another experiment, he put small amounts of hydrogen into the tube. He found a blueish tinge around the cathode. He had found a particle that traveled toward the cathode.

William Crooked found that they traveled in straight lines and were negatively charged
- Bent tube. Glow at elbow
- Magnet bent beam

<pre></pre>
#### Thomson experiment - Electrons
Thomson had a vacuum tube where there was a hole in the anode, allowing the rays through.

He used and **electric field** to bend the ray upwards

He used a **magnetic field** to bend the ray downwards

With both installed, he was able to make a [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Velocity selectors | velocity selector]]

$$
\begin{align}
F_E &= F_B \\
q|\vec{E}| &= qvC_\perp \\
|\vec{E}| &= vC_\perp \\
v &= \frac{|\vec{E}|}{B_\perp} \\
\end{align}
$$ 

Once he found the velocity, he was able to calculate the charge to mass ratio (he neither knew its charge or mass). Similar to a [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Mass spectrometer | mass spectrometer]].

$$
\begin{align}
F_m &= F_c \\
qvB_\perp &= \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
\frac{q}{m} &= \frac{v}{rB_\perp}
\end{align}
$$

He found that different cathode metals had the same $\frac{q}{m}$ ratio.

<pre></pre>
#### Eugene Goldstein - Protons
Goldstein used his cathode ray with hydrogen inside in the same experiment. He found that the $\frac{q}{m}$ ratio was the same as hydrogen ions (that Thomson measured). He had discovered the proton.

<pre></pre>
#### Value of the elementary charge
Finding this value would allow to solve for mass using a $\frac{q}{m}$ ratio.

[[Things to know - Electrostatic and Electric Fields#Millikan's oil drop experiment | Millikan's oil drop experiment]] found charges that were all multiples of $1.6\cdot 10^{-19}C$ which is the smallest unit of charge--the elementary charge

### 5. Plank's quantum theory of matter
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Plank's quantum theory of matter]]
***
$$
E = nhf
$$

* The energy that is distributed among the molecular oscillators is not continuous but instead consists of a <u>finite number of very small discrete amounts of energy</u>.
	* This is called **Plank's *quantum hypothesis***

<pre></pre>
$$
E = \frac{nhc}{\lambda}
$$

> * This equation can be derived with the following equations:

### 7. The Photoelectric Effect
*https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect* \
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Plank's quantum theory of matter]] \
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Work function]] \
The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a material. 
***
#### Hertz's findings
1. A substance only shows a photoelectric effect if the incident light has a frequency <u>**above**</u> a certain <u>**threshold frequency ($f_o$)**</u>
2. Any frequency below $f_o$ will not produce photoelectrons
3. Different metal surfaces have <u>**different $f_o$**</u>
4. Photoelectric current flow is <u>**instantaneous**</u> when external light $\geq f_o$
5. <u>**Increasing frequency**</u> of the incident light does <u>**not affect**</u> the photoelectric current flow
6. The <u>**photocurrent**</u> is <u>**proportional**</u> to the <u>**intensity**</u> of the external <u>**light**</u> source
7. Increasing frequency of the incident light increases the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons
	- $\uparrow f$ light $\Longrightarrow$ $\uparrow E_k$ photoelectron

* An increase in intensity produces a greater photocurrent

### 8. Millikan's photoelectric experiment/stop voltage
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Stop voltage]]
***
He set up the photoelectric tube so that a **reversed voltage** could be applied across the anode and cathode which would stop the ejected photoelectrons from reaching the anode. He called the necessary voltage to stop the photoelectrons the **stop voltage**

$$
E_K = qV_{stop}
$$



<pre>

</pre>
### 9. Frank-Hertz experiment
***
#### Absorption of light
Frank and Hertz bombarded mercury with electron energy. They found that for certain values of electron energy ($4.89eV$, $6.67eV$, $8.84eV$, $9.8eV$), electrons do not make it through the mercury. This is caused by collisions with the mercury atoms. These are called <u>*excitation levels*</u>.

<pre></pre>

- When an electron has less energy than the lowest excitation level, it loses no energy.
	- Ex: an electron with less than $4.89eV$ passes through, losing no energy


<pre></pre>
- When an electron has more energy than any excitation level, can lose energy equal to each excitation level that is of lower energy???
	- Ex: an electron with $9.12eV$ passes through mercury. It can move off with $0.28eV$, $2.45eV$, or $4.23eV$. 
- Collisions are more likely to absorb energy in multiples of its lowest excitation level, therefore electrons that are able to lose multiples of the lowest excitation level are more likely to see a sharp decrease of current.


<pre>

</pre>
Electrons within atoms normally exist in a **ground state** ($0eV$). When they are given enough energy, they jump to an a exited energy state. Only certain excitation levels are allowed.

When an atom's electron is given enough energy and reaches an <u>**ionization level**</u>, the electron leaves the atom which results in a positive atom.



<pre>

</pre>
#### Emission of light
Frank and Hertz noticed that the mercury began emitting light of certain wavelengths. They noticed that these wavelengths corresponded to excitation levels:

[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Plank's quantum theory of matter]]

|$\lambda$||Energy|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$140.6nm$|$\frac{(4.14\cdot 10^{-15})(3.00\cdot 10^8)}{140.6\cdot 10^{-9}}$|$8.84eV$
|$186.4nm$|$\frac{(4.14\cdot 10^{-15})(3.00\cdot 10^8)}{186.4\cdot 10^{-9}}$|$6.67eV$
|$254.0nm$|$\frac{(4.14\cdot 10^{-15})(3.00\cdot 10^8)}{254.0\cdot 10^{-9}}$|$4.89eV$

<pre></pre>
They also noticed wavelengths that weren't from excitation levels:

|$\lambda$||Energy|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$314.4nm$|$\frac{(4.14\cdot 10^{-15})(3.00\cdot 10^8)}{312.3\cdot 10^{-9}}$|$3.95eV$
|$572.9nm$|$\frac{(4.14\cdot 10^{-15})(3.00\cdot 10^8)}{572.9\cdot 10^{-9}}$|$2.17eV$
|$686.8nm$|$\frac{(4.14\cdot 10^{-15})(3.00\cdot 10^8)}{686.8\cdot 10^{-9}}$|$1.81eV$
This is a result of electrons falling to lower excitation levels:
- $8.84eV \longrightarrow 4.89eV = 3.95eV\text{ drop}$
- $8.84eV\longrightarrow 6.67eV = 2.17eV\text{ drop}$
- $6.67eV\longrightarrow 4.89eV = 1.81eV\text{ drop}$

<pre></pre>

[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Photon energy]]
$$
E_{photon} = E_i - E_f
$$

**TL;DR:** An excited electron can release energy corresponding to each fall of energy. Said electron can fall down any combination of descending excitation levels.



<pre>

</pre>
### 10. Absorption of energy
***
<pre></pre>
#### Electrons
The electron in the atom absorbs only the amount of energy corresponding to a jump from the ground state to an excitation state.  The incoming electron continues on with the remaining energy.
- Ex: A $6.00eV$ incoming electron colliding with a mercury atom will lose $4.89eV$ to the atom and then continue on with an energy of $1.11eV$

(As seen in the [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Absorption of light | Frank-Hertz experiment]])


<pre></pre>
#### Photons
The atom will absorb **only** those photons that have energies that **exactly match** the excitation state energies. The remaining wavelengths simply pass through the gas.

<pre>

</pre>
### 11. Spectra
***

<pre></pre>
#### Continuous spectrum
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_spectrum*

When white light passes through a prism, a continuous spectrum of colors is created.
- Looks like a continuous spectrum of colors


<pre></pre>
#### Emission / Bright-line spectrum
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum*

When gas is heated, the electrons produce light when falling to a ground state as seen in [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Frank-Hertz experiment#Emission of light | Frank-Hertz's experiment]]. The electrons only emit certain wavelength of light therefore:
- it looks like strips of color emitted on a black spectrum

The colors and locations of the bright lines change when different gases are used.
**Spectral analysis** analyses the emission spectra of gases to identify them.


<pre></pre>
#### Absorption / Dark-line spectrum
*https://www.khanacademy.org/science/class-11-chemistry-india/xfbb6cb8fc2bd00c8:in-in-structure-of-atom/xfbb6cb8fc2bd00c8:in-in-bohr-s-model-of-hydrogen-atom/a/absorptionemission-lines*

When white light is passed through a cool gas, the gas absorbs the wavelengths of light that [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Photons | exactly match the excitation state energies]]. The electrons only absorbs certain wavelengths therefore:
- it looks like a continuous spectrum with black lines


<pre></pre>
#### Addenda
1. The lines on [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Emission Bright-line spectrum | emission spectra]] and [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Absorption Dark-line spectrum | absorption spectra]] line up. [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Emission Bright-line spectrum | emission spectra]], however, have more lines due to [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Emission of light | intermediate jumps between excitation levels of electrons]].

### 12. X-rays
***
#### Discovery
Wilhelm Roentgen found that barium platinocyanide glowed when in the operating region of a [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#4 Cathode Ray Tube | cathode ray tube]]. He found that it was emitting unknown radiation which he called x-ray.

<pre></pre>
#### Producing x-rays
The easiest way of producing x-rays is by rapidly decelerating electrons as they strike the anode of a [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#4 Cathode Ray Tube | cathode ray tube]]. When the electron strikes the anode, the $E_k$ of the electron is turned into x-ray energy.
- Initial $E_p$ is turned into $E_k$ which is turned into $E_{x-ray}$:

> \begin{align}
> E_p &= E_{x-ray} \\
> qV &= hf \\
> & \text{o}\text{r} \\
> qV &= \frac{nhc}{\lambda}
> \end{align}
> $$

<pre></pre>
#### Properties of x-rays
**Wave characteristics**
- They can penetrate opaque objects (wood, paper, aluminum). They will not penetrate bone
- They can be diffracted by crystals

**Particle characteristics**
- They will ionize a gas
- They will cause electron emission in water
- They will affect photographic plates



<pre>

</pre>
### 13. The Compton Effect
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compton_Effect*\
X-ray collisions are [[Things to know - Momentum and Impulse#Elastic | elastic]].
***
#### Conservation of energy
$$
\begin{align}
E_{before} &= E_{after} \\
E_{x-ray} &= E_{photon} + E_{x-ray} \\
\frac{hc}{\lambda} &= \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{hc}{\lambda} \\
\end{align}
$$

This can be used to find:
- $\lambda$ of x-ray before
- $\lambda$ of x-ray after
- $v$ of the photon

<pre></pre>
#### Momentum
Compton was intrigued by the idea that if photons have energy, do they have momentum?

> [[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Momentum of a photon]]
> $$
> p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
> $$

> [[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Momentum of a photon]]
> $$
> p = \frac{hf}{c}
> $$
> <center>This equation is not on the formula sheet:</center>
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
> p &= \frac{h}{\lambda} \\
> \lambda &= \frac{c}{f} \\
> \\
> p &= \frac{h}{\frac{v}{f}} \\
> p &= \frac{hf}{c} \\
> \end{align}
> $$

Conservation of momentum:

$$
p_{\text{incoming x-ray}} = p_{\text{electron}} + p_{\text{scattered x-ray}} 
$$

Remember that: 
$$
\begin{align}
\vec\sum p_{x} &= \vec\sum p_{x}' \\
\vec\sum p_{y} &= \vec\sum p_{y}' \\
\end{align}
$$

Therefore:
$$
\begin{align}
p_{ix} &= p_{ex} + p_{fx} \\
p_{iy} &= p_{ey} + p_{fy}
\end{align}
$$

<pre></pre>
#### Other
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Compton effect]]
$$
\Delta\lambda = \lambda_f - \lambda_i = \frac{h}{mc}(1-\text{cos}\theta)
$$

### 14. Wave-Particle Nature of Light and Matter
***
Strictly a wave theory of light or strictly a particle theory of light does not work

Light is both a particle and a wave. The properties that we observe depend on 
- Energy $E = hf$
- The kind of experiment we conduct

<b>Particle properties:</b>
- [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#7 The Photoelectric Effect | Photoelectric effect]]
- The [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Absorption of light | absorption]] and [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Emission of light | emission]] spectra.
- Gamma radiation

<b>Wave properties:</b>
- Diffraction
- Interference


<pre></pre>
#### Brogile's wavelength formula
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Brogile's wavelength formula]]
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}
$$

> <center>Derived by:</center>
> 
> Momentum of a particle:\
> [[_Momentum and Impulse Equations#Momentum]]
> 
> $$
> p = mv
> $$
> 
> Momentum of a photon:\
> [[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Momentum of a photon]]
> 
> $$
> p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
> $$
> 
> Deriving:
> $$
> \begin{align}
> p &= p \\
> mv &= \frac{h}{\lambda} \\
> \lambda &= \frac{h}{mv}
> \end{align}
> $$

If his formula was correct, then an electron should demonstrate some wavelength characteristics. Moreover, as $v$ increases $\lambda$ should decrease.

<pre></pre>
#### Orbiting electron waves
Brogile applied the wave nature of the electron to the electrons orbiting hydrogen nuclei. The electron acts like a standing wave spread over an orbit of radius.

Some wavelengths fit ans some do not. When a wave does not constructively close, it dies out. 

Only waves that constructively close are stable. This is a mathematical form of one of [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Bohr - Planetary Model | Bohr's postulates]]:
- There only a few orbits allowed around the nucleus. Each orbit has a characteristic energy and radius. 

It also explains why they do not continuously radiate EMR.

Since circumference equals $2\pi r$ and $n\lambda$ equals whole number values of wavelength:

[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Orbiting electron wave]]
$$
2\pi r = n\lambda
$$

<pre></pre>
#### Quantum indeterminacy
[[_Light Equations#Interference equations]]

Tonomura sent one electron at a time through a double slit arrangement where they would hit a screen where the screen would then glow at that spot. 

After 1000s of electrons, light and dark fringes would appear. Particle waves are waves of probability
- Bright fringes occur where there is a high probability of electrons striking the screen
- Dark fringes occur when there is a low probability of electrons striking the screen


<pre></pre>
According to quantum physics, nature does not always do exactly the same thing for the same set of condition . Instead, the future develops probabilistically.

<pre></pre>
#### Atomic mass units
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit)* \
In nuclear physics **unified mass units** are commonly used because it is more accurate. It is an alternate mass unit to the kilogram.




<pre>

### 16. Isotopes
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope*

Isotopes of an element have the same atomic number but a different atomic mass:

### 17. Mass defect
***
Scientists were able to calculate the **theoretical mass** of isotopes by adding the mass of protons and neutrons 

$$
m_{\text{theoretical}} = m_{\text{protons}} + m_{\text{neutrons}}
$$

They were then able to get the **measured mass** using a [[Things to know - Electromagnetism#Mass spectrometer | mass spectrometer]].

They noticed that the measured mass was always lower than the theoretical mass. They called this the **mass defect** ($\Delta m$).

Physicists interpreted the mass defect and the **binding energy** that holds the protons and neutrons together.



<pre>

</pre>
### 18. Nuclear reactions
***
A **nuclear reaction** is said to occur whenever the incident nucleus, particle, or photon causes a **change** to occur in a **target nucleus**

<pre></pre>
#### Induced nuclear reactions
When something induces the transformation of a target nucleus, it is an induced nuclear reaction.

Induced nuclear transmutations can be used to produce isotopes that are not found naturally.

<pre></pre>
#### Fission reactions
In fission reactions, heavy elements are broken down into smaller nuclei.

Fission involves bombarding particular nuclei with neutrons. Some of the binding energy of the heavy element is converted into radiant energy.

- If neutrons are too **energetic**, they **pass through** the target nucleus
- If the neutron is too **slow**, it will **bounce off** the target nucleus.
- At the right energy level, it will enter the nucleus, destabilizing it which causes it to split.

Problems with fission reactors:
1. Fissionable uranium-235 is very rare
2. The process produces large amounts of deadly radioactive waste
3. The reactors are subject to human and mechanical failures.

> Ex:
> Calculate energy released from the fission of one atom of uranium-235. uranium-235$=234.9934u$, barium-141$=140.388340u$, krypton-92$=91.90601u$.

#### Element formation
Most elements are eventually synthesized from hydrogen.

</pre>
### 19. Radioactivity/Ionizing radiation
***
Previously, we thought that each element had their own element and could not be divided. This is untrue.

Some elements are unstable and decay spontaneously, releasing one or more particles. This is called **radioactive decay**. Alpha ($\alpha$) and beta ($\beta$) particles are emitted along with gamma ($\gamma$) rays.

<pre></pre>
<u>**Alpha particles**</u> ($\alpha$):
- Positively charged particles
	- They are actually the nuclei of helium atoms ${4\atop2}He$
	- Ejected from nucleus
- Ejected at high speed. Low air penetration
- Stopped by aluminum foil

<pre></pre>
<u>**Beta particles**</u> ($\beta$):
- Negatively charged particles
	- High energy electrons ${0\atop -1}e$
- Ejected at various speeds
- Able to penetrate several centimetres of aluminum

<pre></pre>
<u>**Gamma rays**</u> ($\gamma$):
- Neutral 
	- Very short wavelength photons ${0\atop0}\gamma$

#### Conservation laws applied to **alpha decay**
$$
{_4\atop^2}He
$$
A smaller particle is created in alpha decay

We can apply the mass-energy conservation law ($E=mc^2$) to the $E_K$ of the emitted particles.

The $E$ of an $\alpha$ particle should be equal to the energy equivalence of the [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#17 Mass defect | mass defect]].
$$
\Delta m_{\text{defect}}c^2 = E_{K\alpha}
$$

#### Conservation laws applied to **beta decay**

##### Neutrinos
<u>**Conservation of energy**</u>

Conservation of mass-energy does not work as well for beta decay. In beta decay, there was a loss of mass which was not equivalent to the emitted $\beta$ particle.

To account for this, Enrico Fermi suggested the **neutrino** ($\nu$), a <u>neutral</u>, <u>massless*</u> particle
$$
{_1\atop^0}n\longrightarrow{_1\atop^1}p+{_0\atop ^{-1}}e+\nu
$$

\*Neutrinos do indeed have mass (19000 times less than an electron). It is negligible.

<pre>

</pre>
<u>**Conservation of linear momentum**</u>

The neutrino also fixed the conservation of momentum. According to the conservation of momentum, the electron should shoot off in one direction and the proton in exactly the opposite direction, but they are both emitted at an angle. The addition of a neutrino makes the net momentum zero.

<u>**Conservation of angular momentum**</u>

yeah it also fixed this. Deus ex machina much lol

##### Anti particles
There were sometimes discrepancies in stuff

<pre></pre>
<u>**Positrons:**</u>

Same mass as an electron but with opposite charge

##### Types of beta decay
**$\beta^-$ decay**
- Transformation of a **neutron** into a **proton**, an **electron**, and an **antineutrino**.
$$
{_1\atop^0}n\longrightarrow{_1\atop^1}p+{_0\atop^{-1}}e+\bar{\nu}
$$
General form:
$$
 {_A\atop^Z}X\longrightarrow{_A\atop^{Z+1}}Y+{_0\atop^{-1}}\beta+\bar{\nu}
$$
 
<pre>

</pre> 
**$\beta^+$ decay**
- Transformation of a **proton** into a **neutron**, a **positron** and a **neutrino**.
$$
{_1\atop^1}p\longrightarrow{_1\atop^0}n+{_0\atop^{+1}}e+\nu
$$

General form:
$$
{_A\atop^Z}X\longrightarrow{_A\atop^{Z-1}}Y+{_0\atop^{+1}}\beta+\nu
$$

##### Addenda
- Much of the section on [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Conservation laws applied to beta decay | conservation laws applied to beta decay]] is outside of the scope of the Physics-30 curriculum. Strictly speaking, you must know [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Types of beta decay | types of beta decay]].

#### Gamma radiation
When making a <u>transition to a lower-energy</u> state, a nucleus emits a **gamma-ray** photon, similar to the photon emitted when an electron in an atom moves to a lower energy level.

Gamma decay does not necessarily change either the atomic number or the atomic mass.

The energy of a gamma ray depends on the energy levels and the degree of excitation of the particular nucleus.

<pre>

#### Biological effects of ionizing radiation
Ionizing radiation consists of photons/particles that have enough energy to knock an electron out of an atom/molecule. An single $\alpha$, $\beta$, or $\gamma$ can ionize thousands of molecules.

It is dangerous to humans because ionization can significantly alter the structure of molecules within a living cell.

|Radiation|Typical penetration|Ionization|Hazard|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$\alpha$|$5\text{cm}$ in air. Can't penetrate skin|High|Low|
|$\beta$|$30-50\text{cm}$ in air. $1\text{cm}$ into the body|Moderate|Low|
|$\gamma$|Great distances in air. Through human body|Low|High|

Effects of radiation on humans are grouped into:
- Short-term/acute symptoms (minutes to weeks)
- Long-term/obtuse symptoms (years to generations)

### 20. Half life
***
[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations#Half life]]
$$
N = N_o\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n
$$

A half life is the time it takes for $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ of the parent isotope to decay.

### 21. Particle detectors
***
A way to observe small, fast particles. There is an interaction between the particle and the material  of which the detector is made:
- Emission of light
- Ionization of the medium
- Phase or chemical change

<pre></pre>
#### Cloud chamber
Gas supersaturated with vapor will have the vapor condense around the trajectories of the charged ions

If a radioactive source, emitting alpha or beta particles, is put into the container, the moving particles will leave vapor trails behind them as they condense the alcohol vapor. 

<pre></pre>
#### Bubble chamber
Liquid forms of normally gaseous substances are used (propane, hydrogen, helium, xenon)

If the pressure is suddenly lowered, it starts to boil. If a particle is passing through at the same time, it will ionize the substance that it passes, causing it to boil faster.

Frequently, A magnetic field is applied across the chamber which bends the paths of the charged particles. Positive curves in one direction while negative particles curve in the other.

$$
\begin{align}
F_c &= F_m \\
\frac{mv^2}{r} &= qvB\perp \\
\frac{pv}{r} &= qvB\perp \\
\end{align}
$$

Characteristics of trails:
- Short tracks - Weaker collisions
- Inwards spiral - Losing energy/momentum
- Lighter substance - Curve more

### 22. Antiparticles
***
#### Pair production
**Pair production** is a process where electrons and positrons were created simultaneously when a photon collided with the nuclei of a lead plate.

$$
\gamma \longrightarrow{_0\atop^{-1}}e+{_0\atop^{+1}}e
$$

For this to happen, 
1. A photon must collide with a nucleus causing the photon's energy to be transformed into particles (pair production cannot spontaneously happen)
2. The conservation of mass-energy requires that the minimum photon energy must be equal to the rest mass of an electron$+$positron

	[[_Nuclear and Particle Physics Equations]]
	
	
<pre></pre>
#### Pair annihilation
When a particle meets and antiparticle, they annihilate one another. This is called pair annihilation.

This is why positrons aren't normally found in nature:
	The positron is stable. However, when it meets and electron, they annihilate each other and energy in the form of a proton is emitted.

### 23. Nuclear forces
***
If a group of positively charged particles repel each other, what holds the nucleus together?

The **strong nuclear force** binds neutrons and protons together to form nuclei. 
- It binds neutrons and protons together
- It is an attractive force around $1.0\cdot10^{-15}m$
- It is a repulsive force at less than $0.5\cdot1.0\cdot10^{-15}m$ (2 nucleons can't occupy the same space)

<pre></pre>
Why are some nuclei unstable?
1. The strong nuclear force has a short range. 
	- If nucleons are too far apart, the force is too weak
	- If nucleons are too close together, the force is repulsive
2. The action of exotic weak nuclear force which is destabilizing.

### 24. Quarks
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark*
***
A quark is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons.

Hadrons have 2 or 3 quarks

<u>**Modern Model:**</u>
- Protons and neutrons are made of quarks or antiquarks
- Electrons are not made of quarks

<pre></pre>
<u>**Up and down quarks**</u>


|Flavor|Symbol|Charge|Spin|Baryon number|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Up|$u$|$+\frac{2}{3}$|$\frac{1}{2}$|$+\frac{1}{3}$|
|Down|$d$|$-\frac{1}{3}$|$\frac{1}{2}$|$+\frac{1}{3}$|
|(Anti) Up|$\bar u$|$-\frac{2}{3}$|$\frac{1}{2}$|$-\frac{1}{3}$|
|(Anti) Down|$\bar d$|$-\frac{1}{3}$|$\frac{1}{2}$|$-\frac{1}{3}$|

- Proton: $uud$
- Neutron: $ddu$

<pre></pre>
#### Quark properties
- Quarks primarily interact via the [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#23 Nuclear forces | strong nuclear force]].
- There are 3 varieties of quarks and antiquarks. You have to know up and down quarks
- Each quark has a baryon number of $+\frac{1}{3}$. Each antiquark $-\frac{1}{3}$
- Baryons have baryon numbers that add to $1$. Antibaryons have baryon numbers that add up to $-1$.
	- 3 total quarks
- Mesons have baryon numbers that add to $0$ (2 quarks)
- The quark spins add up to the spin of the composite particle
- Each quark has a fractional charge of the fundamental charge. These charges add up to the charge of the composite particle.

<pre></pre>
#### Neutron decay
We learned that a neutron can decay into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. The discovery of quarks made physicists realize that rather than the neutron decaying, one of the quarks was decaying.

Neutron beta decay is when a neutron ($udd$) decays into a proton ($uud$), and electron, and an antineutrino.
