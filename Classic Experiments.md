*[[Things to know - Light#7 Young's double slit experiment]]*
***
$$
\begin{align}
\lambda &= \frac{d\text{sin}\theta}{n} \\\\
\lambda &= \frac{dx}{n\ell} \\
\end{align}
$$

<u>**Experiment:**</u>\
Passed light through 2 slits. The light diffracted and interfered with itself.

<u>**Conclusion:**</u>\
He showed that light was a wave

### Cathode ray tube - Thomson
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube*\
*[[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Thomson experiment - Electrons]]*
***
$$
\begin{align}
F_c &= F_m \\
\frac{mv^2}{r} &= qv\vec B_\perp \\
\frac{q}{m} &= \frac{v}{\vec B_\perp r}\\\\
F_m &= F_e \\
qv\vec B_\perp &= q|\vec E| \\
v &= \frac{|\vec E|}{\vec B_\perp}
\end{align}
$$

<u>**Experiment:**</u>\
Using a magnetic field and an electric field, he was able to measure the charge to mass ratio of electrons $\left(\frac{q}{m}\right)$.

<u>**Conclusion:**</u>\
Since he didn't know the charge nor the mass of the particle, he was only able to determine the charge to mass ratio $\left(\frac{q}{m}\right)$.

*[[Things to know - Electrostatic and Electric Fields#Millikan's oil drop experiment]]*
***
$$
\begin{align}
F_E &= F_g \\
q|\vec{E}| &= mg \\
q\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d} &= mg \\
q &= \frac{\Delta dmg}{\Delta V} \\
q &= \frac{mg}{|\vec E|} \\
\end{align}
$$

<u>**Experiment:**</u>\
He suspended a fine mist of ail droplets in a magnetic field, balancing $F_E$ and $F_g$

<u>**Conclusion:**</u>\
He was able to measure the elementary charge.

### Gold foil - Rutherford
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiments*\
*[[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Rutherford - Nuclear Model Gold foil experiment]]*
***
<u>**Experiment:**</u>\
He fired alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil and observed the scattering of the alpha particles to get a picture of the internal structure of the atom.

<u>**Conclusion:**</u>\
He determined that [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Thomson - Plum-Pudding Model | Thomson's model]] was not correct and created [[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#Rutherford - Nuclear Model Gold foil experiment | his own model]] where most of the mass was in the center of the atom and the rest was mostly empty space which comprised most of the space of the atom.

### Mercury vapor - Frank-Hertz
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franck%E2%80%93Hertz_experiment*\
*[[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#9 Frank-Hertz experiment]]*
***
<u>**Experiment:**</u>\
They bombarded mercury vapor with electron energy. They found that certain values of electron energy did not make it through the vapor.

<u>**Conclusion:**</u>\
Electrons lost energy in quantum packages when they were shot through mercury vapor.

### X-ray collision - Compton
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering*\
*[[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#13 The Compton Effect]]*
***
$$
\begin{align}
p &= \frac{h}{\lambda} \\\\
p &= \frac{hf}{c} \\\\
\Delta\lambda &= \lambda_f - \lambda_i = \frac{h}{mc}\left(1-\cos\theta\right)
\end{align}
$$

<u>**Experiment:**</u>\
He scattered X-rays off metal  foils.

<u>**Conclusion:**</u>\
He found that EMR had momentum that could be transferred to electrons in the metal.

### Wave-particle nature of EMR - DeBroglie
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave*\
*[[Things to know - Nuclear and Particle Physics#14 Wave-Particle Nature of Light and Matter]]*
***
$$
\begin{align}
\lambda &= \frac{h}{mv} \\
\end{align}
$$
Louis de Broccoli postulated that particles has wave properties just as EMR has particle like properties.
