### No explicit values given
***
When a question gives no explicit values and only gives increases/decreases of values
> Ex:\
> Two point charged objects produce an electric force of $0.0620N$ on each other. What is the electric force if the distance between them increases three times and one of the charges is doubled? 

<u>**Solving:**</u>
1. Get original equation\
$f(x)=x$

2. Multiply/divide the variables that were increased/decreased\
$ax$

3. Separate the coefficients\
$a\cdot x$

4. Substitute in the original equation\
$f(x)a$

5. Profit

#### Abridged ver.
<u>**Solving:**</u>
1. Get original equation\
$f(x)=x$

2. Set each variable to $1$. Add the changes that the question says to the variables\
$x = a\cdot 1$

3. Substitute the variables into the original equation\
$x=a$

4. This number is the ratio between the old and the new value. Multiply the old value with it to get the new value\
$af(x)$
