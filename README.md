# AB Phys 30 review sheet

## This is more or less a TL;DR of the notes
In general, there are no:
* Examples
* Practice problems

## Things to consider:
1. This sheet assumes a **general base level of knowledge** and should be used in addition to examples and practice problems.
	* There may be information gaps in the sheet

2. This is written in [.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format and uses [Obsidian links](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks). It is best used in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to utilize links in the doc however it is possible (however not ideal) to read it in a general Markdown viewer.
	* [Get Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

4. [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) formatting is heavily used and recommended that a viewer that supported LaTeX is to be used.
	* Obsidian supports LaTeX
